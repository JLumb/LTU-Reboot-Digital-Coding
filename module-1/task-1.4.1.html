  What have I learnt?
  
  i have learnt how to clone files on github and export them to visual studio code so that i can edit them
  and re upload to github with the final edit. also got the sources for a lot of selflearning tools/channels to help me with my coding journey.
  
  How did I use this in practice?

  started using freecodecamp from the sources i was given in class
  edited this CPD text to keep a track of my progress 
  
  
  
  What did I find hard?
  as this was the very basics and we didn't begin coding i didn't struggle with anything in this class
