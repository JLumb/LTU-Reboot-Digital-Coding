CPD activity
Introduction to Web Development


What have I learnt?

i have learnt how to clone files on github and export them to visual studio code so that i can edit them
and re upload to github with the final edit. also got the sources for a lot of selflearning tools/channels to help me with my coding journey.

How did I use this in practice?
started using freecodecamp from the sources i was given in class
edited this CPD text to keep a track of my progress 



What did I find hard?
as this was the very basics and we didn't begin coding i didn't struggle with anything in this class
